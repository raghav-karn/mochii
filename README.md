Welcome to a polished shoe shop! Hope you like it! ~~PS: got some easter eggs to look for!~~

This is the original repository of the shoe store, and although might be messy, it is the og!

**Note**: site isnt complete with buttons and some links not working. Plus, this is largely based on [CSS code blocks](https://tailblocks.cc/), and much of it isn't my effort to build it from scratch but rather modifying it to our liking. `

- [ ] Bought a new shoe?

Any, and all, recommendations and contributions are welcomed. ``` :D ```
